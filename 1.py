Q.What Is An Access token?
Ans.An access token is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. 
    The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread.
    When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. 
    If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.
